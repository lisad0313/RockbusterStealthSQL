## Intrduction
This reposiory contains the SQL-based analysis of the fictional movie rental company Rockbuster Stealth LLC. Known for having stores around the world, they are now  facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. Therefore, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to
launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

## Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and
they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are
the main questions they’d like to answer:
● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Tools and Data
This project utilized pgAdmin 4 and PostgreSQL to analyze Rockbuster's relational database management system, which includes several files with information about inventory, customers, payments, stores, staff, and more. Visualizations were created using Tableau.
